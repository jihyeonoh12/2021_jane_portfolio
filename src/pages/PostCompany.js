                We wanted to design and build company page where we can talk about the mission statment and the culture of the company. Main purpose of this page is to list out job posting and help future employees to understand what is like to be working at Fresh N Lean.
                Later down the project, the marketing team has decided to combine the company page with press page so user can easily access the latest news and media assets all in one place.
