            The objective of this project is to enable users to mix and match different meal plans and filter ingredients for their meal selections. The issue with the original meal plan system was that users could only choose meals from a single plan, which we found too restrictive. To address this, we transformed the meal plan subscription into a preference-based system, incorporating fields such as diet, protein, allergy, and exclusion."

                We began by updating the existing usePlan hook. The callback function that updated meal plan options was removed and replaced with an updatePreference callback. This new callback updates the subscription value when a new option is selected from the dropdown. Finally, when updatePreference is called, the checkPreferenceType function is invoked to return a list of protein, allergy, and exclusion ingredient options. </p>

From this project, I learned how to enhance a meal plan subscription system by transitioning from a single meal plan model to a more flexible, preference-based model. This involved updating queries, restructuring subscription objects to include diet, protein, allergy, and exclusion fields, and making frontend updates, such as integrating dynamic dropdowns and validation functions.
